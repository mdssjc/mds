## Quick Reference Guide

**Care About Your Craft**

Why spend your life developing software unless you care about doing it well?

**Think! About Your Work**

Turn off the autopilot and take control. Constantly critique and appraise your work.

**Provide Options, Don't Make Lame Excuses**

Instead of excuses, provide options. Don't say it can't be done; explain what can be done.

**Don't Live with Broken Windows**

Fix bad designs, wrong decisions, and poor code when you see them.

**Be a Catalyst for Change**

You can't force change on people. Instead, show them how the future might be and help them participate in creating it.

**Remember the Big Picture**

Don't get so engrossed in the details that you forget to check what's happening around you.

**Make Quality a Requirements Issue**

Involve your users in determining the project's real quality requirements.

**Invest Regularly in Your Knowledge Portfolio**

Make learning a habit.

**Critically Analyze What You Read and Hear**

Don't be swayed by vendors, media hype, or dogma. Analyze information in terms of you and your project.

**It's Both What You Say and the Way You Say It**

There's no point in having great ideas if you don't communicate them effectively.

**DRY–Don't Repeat Yourself**

Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.

**Make It Easy to Reuse**

If it's easy to reuse, people will. Create an environment that supports reuse.

**Eliminate Effects Between Unrelated Things**

Design components that are self-contained. independent, and have a single, well-defined purpose.

**There Are No Final Decisions**

No decision is cast in stone. Instead, consider each as being written in the sand at the beach, and plan for change.

**Use Tracer Bullets to Find the Target**

Tracer bullets let you home in on your target by trying things and seeing how close they land.

**Prototype to Learn**

Prototyping is a learning experience. Its value lies not in the code you produce, but in the lessons you learn.

**Program Close to the Problem Domain**

Design and code in your user's language.

**Estimate to Avoid Surprises**

Estimate before you start. You'll spot potential problems up front.
