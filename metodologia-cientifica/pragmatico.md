## Quick Reference Guide
**Care About Your Craft**

Why spend your life developing software unless you care about doing it well?

**Think! About Your Work**

Turn off the autopilot and take control. Constantly critique and appraise your work.

**Provide Options, Don't Make Lame Excuses**

Instead of excuses, provide options. Don't say it can't be done; explain what can be done.

**Don't Live with Broken Windows**

Fix bad designs, wrong decisions, and poor code when you see them.

**Be a Catalyst for Change**

You can't force change on people. Instead, show them how the future might be and help them participate in creating it.

**Remember the Big Picture**

Don't get so engrossed in the details that you forget to check what's happening around you.

**Make Quality a Requirements Issue**

Involve your users in determining the project's real quality requirements.

**Invest Regularly in Your Knowledge Portfolio**

Make learning a habit.

**Critically Analyze What You Read and Hear**

Don't be swayed by vendors, media hype, or dogma. Analyze information in terms of you and your project.

**It's Both What You Say and the Way You Say It**

There's no point in having great ideas if you don't communicate them effectively.
